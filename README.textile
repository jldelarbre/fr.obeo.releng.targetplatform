h1. Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator

!https://travis-ci.org/jldelarbre/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform.png?branch=master!:https://travis-ci.org/jldelarbre/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform

p=. _Fork of original Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator, but with variables usable in @tpd@ files._

Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator provides a DSL with an advanced editor and a generator taking this DSL as input and generating a @.target@ file that PDE is able to read to provision a Target Platform.

The greatest thing about this tool is that it avoids you to manage the links to strict versions (e.g., @3.2.5.v20093493-sfoit-v-rrel@) in @.target@ files. It lets you define the bundles and features you want to use in your target platform and it handles the generation of the @.target@ file with the most recent available version. It is possible to restrict the lookup within a version range.

h2. Installation

Add the following p2 repository (update-site) in your update manager (in Eclipse, @Help Menu > Install New Software...@, @Add...@ button on the top right corner)

*http://jldelarbre.github.io/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform/p2/* or *http://jldelarbre.github.io/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform/p2/latest/* for the latest version only.

Then, select the _Target Platform Definition DSL and Generator_ feature and click on @Finish@.

bq. This tool requires Xtext 2.7.0 or later. You may need to add the Xtext update site to the list of the available update sites to be able install and/or update Xtext: *http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases/*

h3. Requirements

* Java SE 6

* Eclipse 3.7+ (tested on 3.8/4.2 and 4.3)

* Xtext 2.7.0+

h2. Basic usage

* Create a file with @.tpd@ extension

* Once done, right-click on the file and select _Create Target Definition File_. You can also use the the keyboard shortcut @Alt + R@ (@⌥ Alt + R@ on Mac).

* To activate the target platform, you can either use the _Set as Target Platform_ action which is available on right-clicking on a @.tpd@ file, or use the @Ctrl + R@ (@⌘ Cmd + R@ on Mac) keybinding.

!http://jldelarbre.github.io/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform/screenshots/context-menu.png(The right-click command)!

* You can also right-click on an opened file and choose @Validate@, it will look for any error and will also check if all repositories are available and if all specified installation unit are available within the repository (and respecting the version range if any).

h3. Syntax

An empty file is a valid file.

Strings can be surrounded by either simple quotes @'@ or double quotes @"@.

An ID is a character sequence starting with an alpha (no space allowed).

Keywords can be escaped by prefixing them with @^@.

You must start by defining the name of your target by specifying the header.

<pre>
target "The name of my target"
</pre>

Then you can optionally include other target platform files if you decided to split your target platform definition into several files. This will still lead to the generation of a single @.target@ file.

<pre>
include "base.tpd"
include "http://git.some.server.org/tree/tp/all.tpd"
</pre>

You can define some options about what should be retrieved from the p2 repository. You can do that with the @with@ keyword.

<pre>
with source allEnvironments	
</pre>

Available options are:

* @requirements@, whether this target must have all required IUs of the selected IUs available and included in the target to resolve successfully. If this option is true, the planner will be used to resolve otherwise the slicer is used. The planner can describe any missing requirements as errors.
* @allEnvironments@, whether this target should download and include environment (platform) specific units for all available platforms (vs. only the current target definition's environment settings).  Only supported  by the slicer so @requirements@ must not be used for this setting to be used.
* @source@, whether this location should download and include source bundles for the selected units if the associated source is available in the repository.
* @configurePhase@, whether this target should execute the configure phase after fetching the selected units.

bq. @source@ and @configurePhase@ are not supported by PDE before 3.8. If you use a version of PDE older than 3.8, these options will simply be ignored.

You can define the environment of your target platform about what should be retrieved from the p2 repository. You can do that with the @environment@ keyword. Content assist is your friend to find proper values.

<pre>
environment linux gtk x86_64
</pre>

Then, you define the locations of your p2 repositories. You can add as many locations as your want to your target. Location string must be URL, if your p2 repository is local, don't forget to put a @file:/@ URL.

<pre>
location "http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler/" 
</pre>

A location may have an ID that can be written before or after the URI. This is useful if you want to apply some maven stuff (providing a password, a mirror...) for this repository (see "#17":https://github.com/mbarbero/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform/issues/17 for examples).

<pre>
location kepler "http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler/" 
</pre>

Then, you may list the Installable Units (IUs) your want to include in your target. This can be _bundles_ or Eclipse _features_ (it may end with @feature.group@).

<pre>
location "http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler/" {	
    org.eclipse.emf.sdk.feature.group
}
</pre>

bq. Don't forget that you can escape a keyword by prefixing it with @^@, e.g. if you need to reference a bundle name @environment@, write it like @^environment@. The @^@ will be automatically stripped during the generation.

If no version is specified, the most recent IUs will be selected in the repository. You can restrain the range of version to use by using the same syntax as in @MANIFEST.MF@ files.

<pre>
location "http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno/" {
    // select the most recent version of EMF after 2.7.0
    org.eclipse.emf.sdk.feature.group 2.7.0
    // select the most recent eclipse.rcp feature within the given range 
    org.eclipse.rcp.feature.group [4.0.0,4.3.0)
}
</pre>

Then, the most recent version of the given IU within this range will be selected.

bq. You can use the special keyword @lazy@ as version to state that you don't want the generator to select the version to put in the @.target@ file. Instead, it puts @0.0.0@ which is interpreted by PDE during the resolution of the @.target@.

h3. TPD file with variables

h4. Define a variable

In a @tpd@ file, you can define a variable this way:

<pre>
define variableName="someString"
</pre>

A variable is always a string.

h4. Variable importation

When you include a @tpd@ file into another @tpd@ file, every variables are imported.

let @mainTarget.tpd@ be:

<pre>
target "mainTarget"
include "subTarget.tpd"
</pre>

and @subTarget.tpd@ be:

<pre>
target "subTarget"
define varName="someValue"
</pre>

@varName@ is available for usage in @mainTarget@. Variable importation works recursively with many sub include targets.

h5. Variable redefinition

If now @mainTarget.tpd@ is:

<pre>
target "mainTarget"
include "subTarget.tpd"
define varName="someOtherValue"
</pre>

@varName@ value in @mainTarget@ is _someOtherValue_. A variable could be redefined in many nested target. Define the same variable twice in the same @tpd@ file is invalid.

h4. Variable usage

h5. Simple case (variable call)

You can call a variable to get its value this way:

<pre>
${varName}
</pre>

h5. Composite string

You can also concatenate static strings and variable calls, this way:

<pre>
"someStaticString" + ${var1} + "foo" + ${var2} + ${var3}
or
${var1} + ${var2}
or even
"foo" + "bar"
</pre>

h5. Other way to define variable

A variable can not only be defined from a static string, but also with composite strings.

<pre>
define myVar=${var1} + "foo" + ${var2} + "bar"
</pre>

Cyclic definitions are forbidden and raise an error.

h5. Places where composite strings could be used

Every places where you can use composite strings are shown with some examples:

* @include@

<pre>
include "myTpd.tpd"
include ${basePath} + ${path} + "filename.tpd"
include ${varURL}
...
</pre>

* @location URL@

<pre>
location ${baseURL} + ${pathURL} + "something" {
    ...
}
location "http://" + ${serverName} + "urlEnd" {
    ...
}
</pre>

* @IU version@

Only simple variable call are usable for @IU version@ (but variables can be defined with composite string).

<pre>
location "someURLEventuallyCompositeString" {
    org.eclipse.emf.sdk.feature.group ${varVersion}
}
</pre>

* -IU-

You can not use composite string for IU, the following example is not valid.

<s><pre>
location "somURL" {
    ${myIU}
}
</pre></s>

h4(#overriding). Overriding variables in imported target

Consider the same example than above (with 2 tpd files):

<pre>
target "mainTarget"
include "subTarget.tpd"
define varName="someOtherValue"
</pre>

<pre>
target "subTarget"
define varName="someValue"
</pre>

If @subTarget@ exists alone @varName@ has the value _someValue_. But inside @mainTarget@, the value of @varName@ is _someOtherValue_. @mainTarget@ (importer target) has overrided @varName@ in @subTarget@ (imported target).
Variables overriding is recursive through many target inclusions.

If you unfold an "include" in "outline view":#outlineView, the node representing an imported target shows the effect of overriding against its variables.

h4. Constant definition

It is not always suitable to override every variables in an imported target. That's where _constant_ comes in. If you define @subTarget@ this way:

<pre>
target "subTarget"
define const varName="someValue"
</pre>

Now @varName@ is no longer overrided and is a _constant_. Its value is always _someValue_.
_Constants_ like _variables_ are imported from imported target:

<pre>
target "mainTarget"
include "subTarget.tpd"
</pre>

<pre>
target "subTarget"
define const myConstant="someValue"
</pre>

Here my constant is imported and exist in @mainTarget@.

h4. Predefine variables

Predefine variables are generated by *TPD* for convenience. Many are defined like user directory, path of the current _tpd_ file and others. You can see them in "outline view":#outlineView.

h4(#outlineView). Outline view with variables

Variables and constants are shown in outline view with dedicated icons according to their origin (local, imported or diamondly imported).

Effective values of variable are displayed. It takes into account the nested variables resolution (if any) but also the overrides to apply (if any). Overrides comes from "environment, command line":#envVar or "importer target":#overriding.
Predefined variables are gathered in the same tree node.

h3. TPD preferences page

!http://jldelarbre.github.io/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform/screenshots/tpd_preferences.png(TPD preferences page)!

@TPD preferences page@ allows to:
* Active overriding of @tpd@ variables with environment variables (it also shows the list of environment variables usable by @TPD@), see also "this section":#envVar
* Define variable override for the current eclipse session (same format as command line arguments)
* Modify warning behavior of duplicated IU (when you have defined the same IU than in an imported tpd)
* Set the number of retry when loading a location or an "include" target

h3. Call the generator from the command line

This project provides an Eclipse application that you can launch from the command line. The ID of the application is @fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform.pde.ConverterApplication@ and is provided by the plugin @fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform@. You can use this app in shell scripts, ant or maven build. If you use Tycho, you may have a look at "this example pom.xml file":https://github.com/jldelarbre/fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform/blob/gh-pages/doc/pom.xml

h4(#envVar). Variable overriding from command line or environment

When the generator is called from command line you can override variable value with command line arguments or environment variables.
In the example _pom.xml_ above, the _maven_ property @targetPlatform.application.args@ holds the command line arguments. You can define them (tpd filenames shall be first, the three last parameters are optional and case incensitive):

# tpd filename list (at least one tpd file is required)
# --useEnv
# --override "list of variable redefinition"
# --maxretry [NUM_RETRY]

Variables are redefined in any target or nested target met.

@--useEnv@ is necessary to take into account environment variables. Command line variables have higher priority than environment variables.

A variable redefinition is simply:

<pre>
varName=newValue
or
varName2="new value with space"
</pre>

@--maxretry@ Set the number of retry when loading a location or an "include" target. NUM_RETRY = 0 and above

Command line arguments examples:

<pre>
myTpd.tpd --useEnv --override var1=someValue var2=otherValue --maxretry 2
myTpd.tpd myTpd2.tpd --override var1=someValue var2=otherValue
myTpd.tpd myTpd2.tpd --useEnv
</pre>

h5. Environment variable format

The name is prefixed with @TPD_VAR_@ and whatever after. Their values are simply like command line redefinition, for instance @TPD_VAR_FOO@ could be:

<pre>
varFoo=newValue
</pre>

h2. Build

Go to @fr.obeo.releng.targetplatform-parent@ and do a @mvn clean package@ or @mvn clean verify@.

h2. Contribute
